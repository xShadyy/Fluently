2. Create server and database called:
```shell 
fluently 
```

3. Inside the **backend** folder run: 
```shell
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

4. Create .env file inside the **backend** folder - look inside **.env.example** for exact instructions

5. From the **backend** folder run:
```shell
npm run seed
```
 
6. You should be good to go, although it's highly recommended to create new user for best experience:
```shell
localhost:3000/register
```

# Fluently Application Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document summarizes the unit tests executed on both the backend and frontend of the application using the **Vitest** testing framework. The primary goal of these tests was to validate the functionality and stability of the system. All tests executed successfully without any issues.

## Test Execution Process

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Installed and configured **Vitest** as the testing framework.
   - Set up the test environments for both backend and frontend components.
   - Integrated the **Mantine Provider** into the frontend testing setup as required by the project.

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Developed a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering the key functionalities of both the backend and frontend.
   - Included tests for both positive scenarios and edge cases to ensure robust validation.

3. **Test Execution**
   - Ran the tests using the command `npm run vitest`.
   - All tests passed successfully, confirming that both backend and frontend components are functioning correctly.

## Results
- **Backend**: All unit tests confirmed that the server-side functionalities are implemented correctly.
- **Frontend**: The tests validated the user interface, with the Mantine Provider ensuring consistent and reliable theming.
